Per this updated magic squares code, I have redone the first few methods (the ones that take the most time complexity). Previously I attempted them iteratively and was disappointed by duplicates so I attempted a recursive implementation that eliminated this redundancy. 

I have split the code in MagicSquare.java into two parts (via comments) and a majority of my updates over winter break were performed on part 1 of the algorithm. 

Now I have methods to tidy up part 2 that uses group theory in a more clever way, but I will wait until my advises have a clearer understanding of part 1 in order to implement these upgrades to part 2. I do believe that a majority of the steps in part 2 can be optimized for a much faster runtime albeit I am not sure how much faster. 

Furthermore, I have split the updated methods from part one into their own separate java files in order to organize the code a bit more and make it a little easier to dissect (instead of scrolling up and down in the MagicSquare.java). Not all methods have been implemented in this way, but it is something I plan on doing to the remaining methods granted there are no valid reasons not too (this will be done after I am satisfied with an updated version that either implements the method faster/cleaner or both). 

In any case if you do plan on dissecting this code, I suggest you do not go past part 1 just yet as I have not yet updated part 2 with the new ideas that I have. 

In any case I hope you enjoy this project as much as I have/am and good luck!
